<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

## üìö Introduction

<b>[Campfire](https://ahhreggi-scheduler.netlify.app/)</b> is a full-stack, single-page React application that allows users to enrol and participate in course Q&A discussion boards.

With many classes now taking place remotely, Campfire allows users to easily discuss course-related questions with fellow students and instructors in an organized manner.

### ü§ù **Collaborators**:
- Maria Regina Sirilan ([**@ahhreggi**](https://github.com/ahhreggi))
- Mitchell Pizzacalla ([**@mpizzaca**](https://github.com/mpizzaca))
- Martin Halas ([**@mar10outof10**](https://github.com/mar10outof10))

This app was created as part of our final project for Lighthouse Labs' Web Development bootcamp. The goal was to create a full-stack application from start to finish in just two weeks.
