<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

## üìö Introduction

<b>[Campfire](https://ahhreggi-campfire.netlify.app/)</b> is a full-stack, single-page React application that allows users to enrol and participate in course Q&A discussion boards.

With millions of students now taking courses online due to the pandemic, it‚Äôs been harder for students to collaborate with their peers the way they would in-person within a classroom. Campfire addresses this problem by allowing users to easily discuss course-related questions with fellow students and instructors 24/7 in a controlled, moderated environment.

### ü§ù **Collaborators**:
- Maria Regina Sirilan ([**@ahhreggi**](https://github.com/ahhreggi))
- Mitchell Pizzacalla ([**@mpizzaca**](https://github.com/mpizzaca))
- Martin Halas ([**@mar10outof10**](https://github.com/mar10outof10))

This app was created as part of our final project for Lighthouse Labs - Web Development Bootcamp. The goal was to create a full-stack application from start to finish in just two weeks.
